        <div class="description-skill-html">
            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>
            This landing page, is only developed with CSS, HTML and Java Script, the source code can be found on my GITHUB page, 
            or if you like a more easy access just click in this link <a href="https://github.com/Cfsilveiras/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Site%20I/Project/Backend.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source Code</a> <br>
            What i know of HTML is beyond the basic, im improving on API access and hosting sites, above that, my next goal is to start making site using NEXT.JS </p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-skill-css">
            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br>
            My knowledge of CSS is beyond the basic too, im willing to learn about tailwaindcss that from where i know is the newest on front-end design.<br>
            Front-end development is my main goal, so i will be improving my skill on CSS and HTML, and start learning about React.JS
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-skill-javasc">
            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br>
            My knowledge of JavaScript is basic, but i can do some things, like this page, that is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, i can do some things with API, but i need to improve my skill on it.</p>


    </div>

        <div class="description-skill-sql">
            <h1>NoSQL</h1>
            <p>A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. <br>
            My knowledge of NoSQL is basic, but i can do some things like create and operating systems with MongoDBCompass.</p>
